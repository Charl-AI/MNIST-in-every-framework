# MNIST in TensorFlow

We use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (2), with [Keras](https://keras.io/). TensorFlow was one of the first successful deep learning frameworks and Keras is an API specification for interacting with frameworks at a high-level of abstraction. TensorFlow went through an overhaul to create TF2, which improved the API and made the Keras integration tighter. Nowadays, TensorFlow is popular in industry and is the easiest framework to productionise.

Notice that, like Pytorch Lightning, we don't need to write any training loops because Keras takes care of that for us. Additionally, the code is quite concise because most of the things we need are already implemented in Keras.
