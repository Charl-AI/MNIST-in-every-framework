# MNIST in Julia

Julia is a popular high level language for numerical and scientific computing and is often compared to MATLAB and Python. Julia code is JIT compiled with LLVM and it has an enthusiastic community.

We use flux.jl, which is the most mature deep learning library, which sits on top of the Zygote.jl autograd library.
