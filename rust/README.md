# MNIST in Rust

Rust is a systems programming language designed around a nice type system and a novel model of ownership. When you write code in Rust, the compiler can check that you're not doing anything that's undefined or unsafe. It is consistently one of the most-loved programming languages.

Rust has not yet seen much adoption for scientific computing or machine learning.
